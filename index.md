# Binh Ng. - Research & Development

Welcome! I'm a researcher focused on environmental monitoring, IoT sensors, and bioreactor systems. This site documents my projects, code examples, and research data.

## 🔬 Research Areas

- **Air Quality Monitoring**: PM2.5 analysis using low-cost sensor networks
- **IoT & Sensors**: Arduino, ESP8266/ESP32-based monitoring systems
- **Bioreactors**: Automated control and monitoring for microalgae cultivation
- **Water Chemistry**: pH, turbidity, and dissolved oxygen monitoring
- **Data Analysis**: Python-based environmental data analysis

## 📚 What You'll Find Here

- **[Documentation](/docs/)**: Technical guides, setup instructions, and tutorials
- **[Code Examples](/code/)**: Reusable Arduino, Python, and IoT code snippets
- **[Projects](/docs/projects.html)**: Overview of my open-source projects
- **[Data Resources](/data/)**: Datasets and analysis examples
